          <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
          <p>Howdy!<br>I have been studying computer science at Texas A&M University since 2018. By studying at Texas A&M,
            I am building a strong foundation in computer science. Various club activities, research projects, and team
            competitions gave me the opportunity to experience real world projects and to learn how I can use my knowledge
            that I learned in school in practical applications. Also, I realized that reading books was not the only way to
            learn and to gain knowledge. By having a conversation with smart classmates and by interacting with great professors
            and TAs, I am able to break through my limits and move forward to be a great computer scientist.

          <h3>Activities</h3>
          <h4>DataThon</h4>
          <p>Datathon was the first data-science-driven event that occurred at Texas A&M University. Each team had 4 members
            and they could be from different schools and majors. I participated as a learner with 3 other people. For half of
            the event, we were able to learn about data science. For the other half of the event, companies that sponsored the
            event gave us challenging problems, and we needed to solve those in a given amount of time. From the experience, I
            learned about the importance of teamwork, reliability and responsibility. Also, I realized that with the right plan,
            direction and doing our best, we could achieve success.

          <h4>Turtle Robotics</h4>
          <p>I joined this club to use my knowledge I gained while studying my major. This club activity was interesting especially
             because I can directly see how robots responds to what I code. Currently, I am working on a project, called "Autonomous
             Subterranean Mapping Robot," which consists of 6 team members including a Ph.D student. After finishing the hardware part
             of the robot, we plan on coding the system part of the robot.

          <h4>Deep Learning</h4>
          <p>
            After I first learned machine learning from DataThon, I became more interested in Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, I
            decided to learn and explore through a research project. Prior to joining the project, I self-studied deep learning with
            a book and some videos from Coursera. <br>

          <h3>Internship</h3>
          <h4>BNF Technology</h4>
          <p>I had an opportunity to work at a software company before coming to United States. I Worked as a part of a quality assurance team to detect the software functional errors
            by implementing test based on specific operational procedures. My main job was testing power plant monitoring application based on an algorithm. Throughout my experience,
            I was fastinated by a subject, computer science and I realized how much it is important to gain knowledge to work efficiently and to be an asset in a company.
